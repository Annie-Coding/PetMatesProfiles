               <p> Prince and Lady are both proud recipitants of countless paticipartion awards from the intitution of DogPowers in the art of
                 night-barking. They are both very keen singers. They will lift their melodic voices in song when they want to come back inside

               <p> Lady LOVES to sleep, sometimes she will sleep all day, and only wake up to move herself to the laundry where she will sleep for
                 the whole night. Prince on the otherhand, is like a shadow. He will follow you all around the house no matter what you are doing.
               He seems to be in awe of the daily routine of his owners, and will stalk them throughout the day to make sure that nothing has changed. </p>
