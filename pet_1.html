        <div class="sub_text"> Prince and Lady's background</div>
        <p> Prince and Lady are both Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs and are litter twins. Their passions in life cover a mutitude of areas. They thoroughly enjoy a good petting and will get cranky if
          your hand leaves their heads. Their favourite food-type are hard pellets, although Prince can get picky some days. Every summer, they get their annual haircut
          which leaves them both looking spunky and very cute. They both absolutely HATE water, so they don't like the beach and they don't like baths. However, in height, they
          both come up just under your knee, so there is really not much they can do to get away from bath-time, except hide under the table. A futile effort, but commendable anyway.

              <div class="sub_text">What Prince and Lady have learned</div>
              <p> Prince and Lady have countless tricks up their sleeves. Prince can jump on command, something he loves to do. If you pat your leg twice, BAM he's
                front paws are slamming on to your leg and his happy tail is wagging hard. Prince can also do a yoga pose - the kneeling position. Lady, in her own right, is a bit of a
                guzzler when it comes to food. She realises the benefits of faster eating when given access to a plate of left-overs, a skill that Prince is terrible at. Prince is a true
                connoisseur at heart. He will sample available food until satified that it is adequate for his royal stomach. However, he is still pretty gullible; when threatened with
                food being taken away, he will eat his food as if it is a buffet.

              <div class="sub_headings"> History</div>
              <div class="sub_text">Where Prince and Lady have lived</div>
              <p> Prince and Lady were born on May 7th 2010 and started their adventure in the Ruiz's family on 8th Dec 2010. from there, they have lived in 2
                houses; happily partrolling the garden during the day, and sleeping in the laundry at night. Prince and Lady both LOVE barking at 'strangers' that walk past the street.
                They both cherish the hours they spend barking and jumping against the glass door. Funnily enough, once the door is opened, they would waddle shyly up to the offending person for pats.

              <div class="sub_text">Why Prince and Lady are special little snowflakes:</div>
              <p> Prince and Lady are the sweetest little pups that anyone could ever lay eyes on. Miraculously, they have still retained their rugged good looks all
                throughout their golden years, with some fellow dog-walkers mistaking them for puppies! Prince and Lady are both expert run-aways. They have made their mark in several
                neighboorhoods, with a new-found celebrity status. Now, whenever they get out for a quick stroll, they will be picked up almost immediately. A special thanks to all those
                watching neighbors who have caught these little devils when they are on one of their escapades. Prince has also mastered the art of theivery. It never ceases to brighten my
                day when we come home to Prince standing on the table and helping himself. Unfortunetly for Lady, she is not as athletic as Prince, so she only watches longingly from the ground.

              <div class="sub_text">Where Prince and Lady's shining personality shines even harder</div>
              <p> Prince and Lady are both proud recipitants of countless paticipartion awards from the intitution of DogPowers in the art of
                night-barking. They are both very keen singers. They will lift their melodic voices in song when they want to come back inside
                and will sing until they are fed every day. Lady has been the clear winning in the 'most-motivated-by-food' award as she will
                do literally anything for what she percieves as an edible object. Prince, on the overhand, can be commended on his considerable
                attempts to suffocate his owners when they are lying on the ground. He has taken a fancy to trying to sit on your face, so don't
                tempt him kids. Lady smashes the competition of 'most-times-on-a-diet' as well as scoring high on the snoring-accessment. And
                yes can she snore.

              <div class="sub_text">What Prince and Lady do for fun</div>
              <p> Lady LOVES to sleep, sometimes she will sleep all day, and only wake up to move herself to the laundry where she will sleep for
                the whole night. Prince on the otherhand, is like a shadow. He will follow you all around the house no matter what you are doing.
                He seems to be in awe of the daily routine of his owners, and will stalk them throughout the day to make sure that nothing has changed.
                Both dogs crave attention, and will savagely nudge each-other out of the way when only one hand is on offer. (eg. when reading a book)
