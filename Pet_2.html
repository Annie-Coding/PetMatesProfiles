              <div class="sub_text">Where Ned has lived</div>
              <p> Unfortunetly, Ned missed out on a lot of deserved love in his early life, spending over 4 months living at the RSPCA. He arrived at his forever home 7 years ago. During this time, he has become very familiar with the back streets and local
                parks of Brunswick, and more recently Northcote. His favourite suburb is Northcote: there are lots of kids around for extra pats :)

              <div class="sub_text">Why Ned is a special little snowflakes:</div>
              <p> Ned happens to be a proficient tail wagger, as well as reliably sitting when asked (especially for treats). He is quite capable of jumping in and out of the car as needed to go on car adventures, as well as barking when the doorbell rings to
                ensure protection of the house. As all good boys are, he is adept at selecting just the perfect toy to support greeting his person at the front door on arrival home from work.
                He is also well known for his amazing architecture skills, building impressive pillow cubbies on the bed.
